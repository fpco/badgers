## Badgers

This is a clone of [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs) that is being used as a training and practice project for some folks that I (Chris Allen) am working with. You're welcome to clone it and kick it around but I won't be taking any PRs or issues from third parties for now until the folks I am helping are done with this project.

## Database Setup

After installing Postgres, run:

```
createuser badgers --password badgers --superuser
createdb -O badgers badgers_dev
createdb -O badgers badgers_test
```

If you're on Linux you might have a `postgres` system user you need to impersonate in order to perform these actions, if that's the case then the commands are:

```
createuser badgers --password badgers --superuser
createdb -O badgers badgers_dev
createdb -O badgers badgers_test
```

There's also Makefile targets that make this easy.

## Haskell Setup

1. If you haven't already, [install Stack](https://haskell-lang.org/get-started)
	* On POSIX systems, this is usually `curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh`
2. Install the `yesod` command line tool: `stack install yesod-bin --install-ghc`
3. Build libraries: `stack build`

If you have trouble, refer to the [Yesod Quickstart guide](https://www.yesodweb.com/page/quickstart) for additional detail.

## Development

Start a development server with:

```
stack exec -- yesod devel
```

As your code changes, your site will be automatically recompiled and redeployed to localhost.

## Tests

```
stack test --flag badgers:library-only --flag badgers:dev
```

(Because `yesod devel` passes the `library-only` and `dev` flags, matching those flags means you don't need to recompile between tests and development, and it disables optimization to speed up your test compile times).

## Documentation

* Read the [Yesod Book](https://www.yesodweb.com/book) online for free
* Check [Stackage](http://stackage.org/) for documentation on the packages in your LTS Haskell version, or [search it using Hoogle](https://www.stackage.org/lts/hoogle?q=). Tip: Your LTS version is in your `stack.yaml` file.
* For local documentation, use:
	* `stack haddock --open` to generate Haddock documentation for your dependencies, and open that documentation in a browser
	* `stack hoogle <function, module or type signature>` to generate a Hoogle database and search for your query
* The [Yesod cookbook](https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod-cookbook) has sample code for various needs

## Getting Help

* Ask questions on [Stack Overflow, using the Yesod or Haskell tags](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/yesod+haskell)
* Ask the [Yesod Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/yesodweb)
* There are several chatrooms you can ask for help:
	* For IRC, try Freenode#yesod and Freenode#haskell
	* [Functional Programming Slack](https://fpchat-invite.herokuapp.com/), in the #haskell, #haskell-beginners, or #yesod channels.
